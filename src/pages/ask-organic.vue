                Arogya Shakti Kendra(ASK) Organic is a brand of organic foodstuff that has been in the business for decades. 
                They have helped a lot of individuals and families chart courses and adopt the organic lifestyle. ASKOrganic’s 
                motto is to spread awareness and allow people to choose an organic lifestyle without burning a hole into their 
                pockets since it was a stigma that foodstuff of the organic grade was well beyond the general populace’s budget. 
                ASKOrganic had been doing all that behind a curtain for decades, up until now. Ortigan constructed a brand philosophy 
                for ASKOrganic. We also helped them define the intent behind their branding and design.

                Ortigan also created a website that included an e-commerce functionality such that the end-user could directly buy from the website without 
                it going through more middlemen and hence, at an affordable price. The back-end of the website is the CMS which also 
                boasts the ability to edit/add/remove any product that the admin wishes to edit/add/remove. Ortigan also designed the 
                packaging for the products of ASKOrganic. The packaging is in total uniformity with the design of the website and the 
                whole brand, which makes the product more appealing to the customer, as well as instills a sense of trust and loyalty 
                towards the whole brand.
